title: Commit to Git
---

It is Sepetember 9th, 2021 and I have decided that I will commit to Git. A little late? I know. This entire blog is a small part of that commitment. So please let me know what you think and if you have suggestions for making these pages better (and more useful) for potential employers and other data scientists.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
