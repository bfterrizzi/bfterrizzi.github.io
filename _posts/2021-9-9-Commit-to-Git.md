title: Commit to Git

Over the course of this week I have spent more and more time working in Github. To be honest, Git has always been challenging to me, mostly because I use it infrequently and have never had to commit to using it in a professional capacity. However, after sucessfully deploying an app hosted on GitHub (more in a later post?), I have gained enogh confidence to tarry here and try to utilize Github for more of my personal projects. 
  
As you can see, I have generated more commits as of late and I look forward to learning and watching the green sea spead further.

So, please let me know what you think and if you have suggestions for making these pages better (and more useful) for potential employers and other data scientists.
