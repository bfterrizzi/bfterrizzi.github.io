**Sepetember 9th, 2021**   
   
Over the course of this week I have spent more and more time working in Github. To be honest, working with Git has always been a challenge for me and I am envious of those that appear to work with it seamlessly. However, after sucessfully wrestling with some challenges related to deploting an app hosted on GitHub (more in a later post?), I have gained enogh confidence to tarry here.
  
As you can see, I have generated more commits as of late and I look forward to learning and watching the green sea spead further.

So please let me know what you think and if you have suggestions for making these pages better (and more useful) for potential employers and other data scientists.
